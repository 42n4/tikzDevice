		 Changes in version 0.6.2 (2011-11-13)

New Features

  - The annotation system has been improved. A new function `tikzNode` has
  been added that makes it easy to insert TikZ nodes with custom options
  and content. `tikzCoord` is now a wrapper for `tikzNode` that simplifies
  the function call required to get a plain coordinate.

  - Annotation of Grid graphics is now supported. New functions
  `tikzAnnotateGrob`, `tikzNodeGrob` and `tikzCoordGrob` allow the creation of
  Grid grobs that execute annotiation commands when drawn to a `tikz` device.
  Wrapper functions `grid.tikzAnnotate`, `grid.tikzNode` and `grid.tikzCoord`
  are also provided. The necessary transformations between Grid coordinates,
  which are viewport-centric, to absolute device coordinates are handled by
  a new function `gridToDevice`.

  - Support has been added for the `dev.capabilities` function in R 2.14.0.

Bug Fixes

  - Fixed a bug where the outline of the background bounding box was being
  drawn with the forground color instead of the background color. This was
  unnoticible except when a non-white background was used. Thanks to Matthieu
  Stigler for reporting.

Behind the Scenes

  - The tikzDevice is now checked with "visual regression testing" which
  compares the results of graphics tests against a set of standard images using
  a visual diff. If a change occurs that significantly affects font metrics
  or graphics primitives the effects will show up in the diff. Currently,
  ImageMagick's `compare` utility is used to calculate differences. This
  process was inspired by the work of Paul Murrell and Stephen Gardiner
  on the graphicsQC package.  Future versions of the tikzDevice may use
  graphicsQC to perform this task.

  - The tikzDevice Vignette used to employ a rather ugly hack that re-wrote
  the internals of the Sweave driver during processing in order to gain more
  control over syntax highlighting. This hack has been replaced by TeX macros
  that achieve the same result without messing with R.
