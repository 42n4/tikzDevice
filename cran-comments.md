## Reasons
* Featurettes and bug fixes

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 14.10 install, R 3.2.2
* win-builder (release; devel passed before but didn't work at all today, tried twice)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs, just a spell checker NOTE
about the name "Tantau".

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on the nine downstream dependencies.
The checks passed, see http://bit.ly/1PwG6s5 for details.
