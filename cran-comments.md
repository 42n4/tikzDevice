## Reasons
* Compatibility fix for R 3.1.3.

## Test environments
* Travis CI, Ubuntu 12.04, R 3.2.3
* win-builder (release and devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs, just a spell checker NOTE
about the name "Tantau" and about "LaTeX".

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on the three downstream dependencies.
The checks passed.
