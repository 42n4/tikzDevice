# This is an experimental branch!

This branch explores the possibility of generalizing the tikzDevice to use
other TeX graphics libraries---specifically the METAPOST library integrated
into ConTeXt.

**This branch is not supported. Bugs will exist. Rebases will happen.**

Here endith the sermon. Have fun!
