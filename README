Version 0.2: Alpha

STATUS:
	The tikzDevice implements the tikz() graphics driver in R. This driver
	is currently complete to the extent that all skeleton routines have been
	implemented. The device *almost* passes the plot(1,1) test.

FIX:
 * when using plot(1,1), all calls to text result in proper output with one
   exception: the coordinates of the text nodes are nan.

 * when using plot(1,1), the bounding box of the plot is almost drawn correctly.
   The line travels through the correct points, then returns to (0,0) which results
   in the right hand side of the plot having a funky edge.

TODO:
	* Currently the device ignores all parameters passed into plotting functions 
		via the pGEcontext variable. These commands contain important information 
		such as color, line type and width and font size/shape.

	* The setup of the text functions is extremely janky. No attempt is made to
		determine string width or font metrics. This could be a possible cause
		of the nan values that show up in the positions of text strings.
